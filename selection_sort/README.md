## Selection Sort

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects **the smallest element** from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element **at the beginning** of the unsorted list.

**Time Complexity**: Best Case = Ω(N^2), Worst Case = O(N^2), Average Case = Θ(N^2)

**Space Complexity**: Worst Case = O(1)
